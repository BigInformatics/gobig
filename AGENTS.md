# Important Information for AI Agents

This file provides guidance to AI Agents and Assistants when working with code in this repository.

## Fundamental principles:

- You must review this document and revisit after any conversation compacting: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Always follow this sequence: Research → Plan → Implement
- Track progress with TODO.md when working on complex tasks
- NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!


## After completing a task

If you start a process or a script that opens a port, you will immediately close it down after you complete a task.  You will also ensure that lock files are removed.

When you do not do this, it interrupts development operations.
